# Contact-Manager
Contact Manager Project
I completed the Contact Manager project, which is a backend project utilizing technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and REST API with a MySQL connection. This project focuses on storing user contact information, allowing users to log in and create accounts to manage their contacts. Key features include:

User Authentication for account creation and login.
